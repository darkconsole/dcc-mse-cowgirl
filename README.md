# Cowgirl Outfit

Moo.

# Includes

* Cowbell collar that ring-a-dings more the faster you are moving. It will mess with your sneak, but here is the thing, the better your sneak gets the better the chance it won't go ding while sneaking. I believe by sneak 75 it will always be silent while sneaking if i recall the maths properly.

* Two colour variants of collar: Iron and Classic Cowgirl Red.

* Hoof stomper boots, gloves, pauldrons, ears/horns, and panties that say "Moo"

* Four colour variants of the outfit: Black, Brown, Mottled (Classic Moo Moo), White.

* Three type variants of the outfit: Clothing with 0 armor for mages, Light, and Heavy. All properly keyworded for perk set bonuses. The ears/horns count as a helmet. All bits have their armor values set to be reasonable with middle-upper quality items.

* All outfit parts craftable at the TANNING RACK (cause cows are leather hue hue), for inexpensive and reasonable amounts of things.

* All outfit parts are enchantable except the collar which is already enchanted to go ring-a-ding.

# Requirements

* Racemenu or NiOverride for the hoofs which operate via NiO HH.
* Bodyslide if you want something not the default UNP shape.

# Credits

The meshes themselves all came from somewhere before I hacked at them.
It has all been edited one way or another to fit with the size or components
I was looking for. Everything has also been retextured and reweighted.

* the hoof part of the hoof stompers were part of a pair made by [xinafay](http://www.loverslab.com/files/file/690-high-heels/) which i cut apart and resized to be comically cartoon sized like in world of warcraft.

* the boot cover, gloves, shoulders, and panties, were part of various components of the [ct77 sets](http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/25259/).

* the ears/horns are from the [calyps](http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/14205/) set.

* the collar is from [hentai creatures](http://www.loverslab.com/files/file/430-hentai-creatures/) with the bell part made by me.
